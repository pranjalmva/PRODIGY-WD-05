<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a well-structured Weather App project using Javascript and OpenWeatherMap API! Here's a breakdown of the code with some suggestions for improvement:

# HTML Structure:

* The HTML uses clear separation for header, search section (weather-input), weather data (weather-data), and separates current weather (current-weather) from 5-day forecast (days-forecast).
* Class names are used for styling the elements in a separate CSS file (linked in the "<head>" section).

# Content:

* The user can enter a city name in the search bar and click the "Search" button to retrieve weather information.
* Alternatively, the user can use the "Use Current Location" button to display weather data based on their geolocation.
* The current weather section displays city name, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
* The 5-day forecast section displays weather details for the next five days, including day, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

# Functionality:

* The JavaScript code (script.js) fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on either city name or user location.
* The script uses an API key (API_KEY) to authenticate with the OpenWeatherMap API (replace with your own key).
* Error handling is implemented to display alerts in case of issues fetching data or geolocation permission.

# Suggestions for Improvement:

* Visual Design: Consider adding a background image or color scheme to enhance the app's visual appeal.
* Responsiveness: Ensure the app layout adapts well on different devices (mobile, tablet) by using media queries in your CSS.
* Search History: Implement a feature to store recent city searches for easier access.
* Loading Indicator: Display a loading indicator while fetching weather data to improve user experience.
* Detailed Forecast: Provide more details in the 5-day forecast, such as chance of rain or high/low temperatures.
